grub-imageboot
--------------

If you want to use this script just place your floppy images (with
suffix .img) or you iso files (with suffix.iso) to /boot/images and run
update-grub2 afterwards.

Booting isos and floppy images with memdisk has limitations - see
http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/MEMDISK if you have booting
problems.

If you want to change the path were images are dropped adapt $IMAGES in
/etc/default/grub-imageboot.

If you need special options to boot your images see $IMAGEOPTS and
$ISOOPTS in /etc/default/grub-imageboot.
